## Why Jam?

### For Beginners

- **Intuitive Syntax** — English-like commands that make sense right away  
- **Beginner-Friendly Learning Curve** — No complex symbols or obscure syntax  
- **Interactive Feedback** — Built-in interpreter for immediate results  
- **Helpful Guidance** — Get warnings and tips as you learn  

### For Professionals

- **JavaScript Compilation** — Convert Jam into clean, production-ready JavaScript  
- **Type Inference** — Smart type detection and warning system  
- **Modern Features** — Functions, lambdas, maps, timers, and more  
- **Extensible Architecture** — Easily add new features or tools

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UnitaryIron/Jam-Backend.git
cd Jam-Backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Your First Jam Program

### Create a file called hello.jam:

```jam
# Welcome to Jam!
say "Hello, World!"
```
Run with the Jam interpreter:
```python
python jam.py hello.jam
```
Or compile to JavaScript:
```
python jam.py --compile hello.jam > hello.js
node hello.js
```

## Language Guide

### Variables
```jam
set message = "Hello Jam!"
set count = 42
set pi = 3.14159
set is_active = true
set numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Control Flow
```jam
# Basic variable assignment and arithmetic
set x = 10
set y = 5
set name = "Alice"

# Conditional logic
if x > y {
    print "x is greater than y"
} else if x < y {
    print "x is less than y"
} else {
    print "x equals y"
}
```

### Loops
```jam
repeat 5 {
    print "This will print 5 times"
}
```

### Functions

Named function:
```jam
function greet (name) {
    add "Hello, " and name into message
    print message
    return message
}
```

Anonymous function (lambda):
```jam
function anonymous (x, y) {
    add x and y into result
    return result
}
```

Calling functions:
```jam
call greet("World")
set sum_result = call anonymous(5, 7)
print sum_result
```

### Operations

Math operations:
```jam
# Basic arithmetic
set a = 15
set b = 3

add a and b into sum
print sum

multiply a and b into product
print product

# Math functions
square of a into a_squared
print a_squared

sqrt of 64 into root
print root

# Random numbers
random between 1 and 100 into lucky_number
print lucky_number
```

String operations:
```jam# String manipulation
set message = "hello world"

uppercase message into upper_msg
print upper_msg

lowercase message into lower_msg
print lower_msg

reverse message into reversed_msg
print reversed_msg

# String concatenation
set first = "Hello"
set last = "World"
add first and " " into temp
add temp and last into greeting
print greeting
```

List operations:
```jam
# Array creation and manipulation
set numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
set names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

length of numbers into count
print count

# Map function
set doubled = map (n) => n * 2 over numbers
print doubled

set greetings = map (name) => "Hello " + name over names
print greetings
```

Map (transform array):
```jam
set doubled = map (n) => n * 2 over numbers
```

### Utilities

Timing execution:
```jam
# Performance timing
timer start

repeat 1000 {
    set x = 1 + 1
}

timer stop
```

Random values:
```jam
# Random selection
choose from ["rock", "paper", "scissors"] into choice
print choice
```

User input:
```jam
# Getting user input
ask "What is your name?" and store in user_name
add "Hello, " and user_name into welcome_message
print welcome_message

ask "Enter first number:" into num1
ask "Enter second number:" into num2
add num1 and num2 into total
print total
```

## Architecture
Jam is built with a dual-path architecture:

- Interpreter: Runs Jam directly in Python for quick testing
- Compiler: Transpiles Jam into readable, performant JavaScript

Core Components:

- Parser — Converts Jam syntax into an abstract syntax tree
- Type System — Provides inference and developer-friendly warnings
- JavaScript Transpiler — Outputs clean, idiomatic JavaScript
- Standard Library — Built-in support for common operations

## Vision
Jam aims to be the most approachable language without sacrificing power or extensibility.

Roadmap
- Web-based playground
- Package manager for Jam modules
- Optional static type annotations
- Debugger and developer tools
- Expanded standard library
- Performance improvements
