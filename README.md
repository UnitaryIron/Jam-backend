## Why Jam?

### For Beginners

- **Intuitive Syntax** — English-like commands that make sense right away  
- **Beginner-Friendly Learning Curve** — No complex symbols or obscure syntax  
- **Interactive Feedback** — Built-in interpreter for immediate results  
- **Helpful Guidance** — Get warnings and tips as you learn  

### For Professionals

- **JavaScript Compilation** — Convert Jam into clean, production-ready JavaScript  
- **Type Inference** — Smart type detection and warning system  
- **Modern Features** — Functions, lambdas, maps, timers, and more  
- **Extensible Architecture** — Easily add new features or tools

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UnitaryIron/Jam-Backend.git
cd Jam-Backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Your First Jam Program

### Create a file called hello.jam:

```jam
# Welcome to Jam!
say "Hello, World!"
set name = ask "What's your name?" into name
print "Welcome " + name + "!"
```
Run with the Jam interpreter:
```python
python jam.py hello.jam
```
Or compile to JavaScript:
```
python jam.py --compile hello.jam > hello.js
node hello.js
```

## Language Guide

### Variables
```jam
set message = "Hello Jam!"
set count = 42
set pi = 3.14159
set is_active = true
set numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Control Flow
```jam
if temperature > 30 {
    say "It's hot outside!"
} else if temperature > 20 {
    say "It's warm outside!"
} else {
    say "It's cool outside!"
}
```

### Loops
```jam
repeat 5 {
    print "This will print 5 times"
}
```

### Functions

Named function:
```jam
function greet (name) {
    return "Hello " + name + "!"
}
```

Anonymous function (lambda):
```jam
set double = function anonymous (x) {
    return x * 2
}
```

Calling functions:
```jam
call greet "Jam Developer"
print double(21)
```

### Operations

Math operations:
```jam
add 5 and 3 into result
multiply result and 2 into final
```

String operations:
```jam
uppercase "hello" into shout
reverse "Jam" into backwards
```

List operations:
```jam
set numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
length of numbers into count
```

Map (transform array):
```jam
set doubled = map (n) => n * 2 over numbers
```

### Utilities

Timing execution:
```jam
timer start
# ... your code ...
timer stop
```

Random values:
```jam
random between 1 and 100 into lucky_number
choose from "apple", "banana", "cherry" into fruit
```

User input:
```jam
ask "What's your name?" into username
print "Hello " + username
```

## Architecture
Jam is built with a dual-path architecture:

- Interpreter: Runs Jam directly in Python for quick testing
- Compiler: Transpiles Jam into readable, performant JavaScript

Core Components:

- Parser — Converts Jam syntax into an abstract syntax tree
- Type System — Provides inference and developer-friendly warnings
- JavaScript Transpiler — Outputs clean, idiomatic JavaScript
- Standard Library — Built-in support for common operations

## Vision
Jam aims to be the most approachable language without sacrificing power or extensibility.

Roadmap
- Web-based playground
- Package manager for Jam modules
- Optional static type annotations
- Debugger and developer tools
- Expanded standard library
- Performance improvements
